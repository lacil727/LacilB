<p>The first Digital Humanities session for the year 2022 was a much-needed one for me. Not only did it provide me with perspective as to where we are as a team in terms of continuing the Writers, Readers, and Scenes: Visualizing Caribbean Literature digital project, it also was a refresher on many different areas of DH that we touched on during the first semester. During this session, we revisited old tools and discovered a few new projects from other Digital Humanities Scholars. </p>

<p>It was absolutely amazing to visualize these new projects as they gave me insight into the endless possibilities of the Digital Humanities field. As a Digital Humanities student myself who will soon create a solo digital project, the introduction to the new tool twine and hypothesis was a great addition to my knowledge of more DH tools. Overall, I found twine relatively easy to maneuver with, however, it would not be suitable for the idea that I have for my solo project since I am unable to visualize how I would successfully transform my goal for the project using twine.  The tool Hypothesis was also very interesting to learn how to use. The idea of social annotations is an incredible concept and I enjoyed annotating the parts on Dr. Esprit's webpage entitled Topography, Topology, Typography: The Library as Place, Text, and Tool in Caribbean Digital Research Classrooms which stood out to me.</p>

<p>The Introduction to Arcgis was hands down my favorite session while doing Digital Humanities. I truly appreciated the fact that Dr.Esprit was able to share some insight and her experience of a project where she mapped out the community where she grew up. She really opened my eyes to understand why it is that some buildings in the village of Mahaut are constructed the way they are. She also provided us with a little history of how the slaves were only given a very small piece of land in order to start their settlement.</p>

<p>All in all, the introduction to ArcGIS really fueled my interest in the program and during that very session I decided that I would definitely use the software to bring the idea for my solo project to life </p>
